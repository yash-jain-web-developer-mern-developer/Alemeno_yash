# Credit Approval System

This is a credit approval system built with Django, PostgreSQL, and Docker. It is designed to manage customers and their loans. The system includes functionality for creating customers, managing loans, and viewing loan details through an API.

## Assignment Notes

- **Dockerized Application**: All services, including the web application and PostgreSQL database, are containerized using Docker. You can run the entire application with a single `docker-compose up --build` command.

- **Code Quality**: The code is structured to ensure clear separation of concerns with models, views, serializers, and tests organized properly.

- **Submission Instructions**:
  - Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
  - Install Docker and Docker Compose (if not already installed).
  - Run `docker-compose up --build` to start the application and all its dependencies.
  - The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/`.

- **Bonus**: Unit tests were added for models and views to ensure code reliability.
